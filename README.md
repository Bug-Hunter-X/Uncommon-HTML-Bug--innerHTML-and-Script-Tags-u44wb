This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to the use of `innerHTML` to inject content containing `<script>` tags.  The bug occurs because directly using `innerHTML` to set content that includes a `<script>` tag may lead to unexpected script execution or browser errors depending on context and browser's security policy. The solution offers a safer approach to dynamically adding script tags to avoid security risks and ensure consistent behavior across browsers.
